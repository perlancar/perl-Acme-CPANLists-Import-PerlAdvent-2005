<h1><a href="../">YA Perl Advent Calendar</a> 2005-12-25</h1>
Toys! There are a couple of un*x standbys: fortune, rain and banner. Banner was
to some extent superceded sometime ago by the venerable figlet, a banner on
steroids. Being a fan of ASCII-art I became interested in figlet sometime ago
and eventually decided to have a go at implementing it in perl. So, back in
2000 I released
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Text::FIGlet">Text::FIGlet</a>.
Yes indeedy, now you can enjoy the excitement of figlet all from within the 
comforts of perl; we might even get a functional/more portable
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Acme::Curses::Marquee">Acme::Curses::Marquee</a>
out of it. I gave a lightning talk about the module at Boston.PM awhile
