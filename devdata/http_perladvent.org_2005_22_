I'm heading out of town for the holidays tomorrow afternoon and so have been
busy preparing, I apologize for the scanty coverage today. I will have only
intermittent connectivity at best, however I still hope to finish out the
calendar, perhaps prewriting some content tomorrow morning. Or, as always,
if you have a suggestion or would like to contribute: contact jpierce@cpan

Happy Holly Days

Sometimes you'd like to know when perl began supporting a certain feature;
perhaps out of a desire to maintain backward compatibility/document your own
module's feature incompleteness for non-modern perls, or simply as a history
lesson. Well, as far as modules included in the core distribution are concerned
you need look no further than
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Module::CoreList">Module::CoreList</a>.
It provides a method for determining a module's first availability, as well
as version release dates and relatives. Personally, I was surprised to learn
how old Math::Big* is&mdash;available as far back as 5.00!
<p>
As of yet, there does not seem to be a comparable resource for CORE features,
although it's been on my LIKETODO list for sometime.
