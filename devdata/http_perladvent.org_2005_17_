<h1><a href="../">YA Perl Advent Calendar</a> 2005-12-17</h1>
As is tradition around this time of the calendar, we bring you a module devoid
of almost any practical value which you are sure to love&ndash;that is if you
can get it, or rather its dependencies, installed&ndash;<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Acme::POE::Knee">Acme::POE::Knee</a>. Despite the
POD-page's statement, POE::Knee is a sort of retro-homophone and not an
acronym. But what is POE::Knee? It's a lot like using the company mainframe to
find someone without a sixth degree of Kevin Bacon. POE::Knee uses Perl and
POE to race virtual horses.
