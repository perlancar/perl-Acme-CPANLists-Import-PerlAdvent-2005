<h1><a href="../">YA Perl Advent Calendar</a> 2005-12-20</h1>
If you checked out yesterday's Test::Perl::Critic you've seen one application
of Adam Kennedy's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=PPI">parse
perl without perl</a>; more accurately described as parse perl in runtime
without the perl compiler. Today's module,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Perl::Compare">Perl::Compare</a>
is another application from the man himself. Perl::Compare is a perl-aware
diff and where <tt>diff -qr</tt> might give:

Perl::Compare reports the following (it can also give you a data
structure instead):

<pre class="c">
! Wubbulous.pm
+ blib/lib/Wubbulous.pm
- t/01power.t
- t/02maxpower.t
- t/03eyefish.t
- t/04oleo.t
- t/05conquer.t
- t/06krusty.t
- t/07apu.t
+ t/1.t
+ t/2.t
+ t/3.t
+ t/4.t
+ t/5.t
+ t/6.t
+ t/7.t
</pre>
Note that by default Compare ignored by-products of editing, and some of those
from make-ing the module like the Makefile and man pages in blib (but not the
library). Of course, the difference in output there is mostly prettiness and
due to Perl::Compare's filtering. On the other hand, when completed,
Perl::Compare ought to be able to recognize the following two snippets as
identical:
<pre>
   1 <span class="k">if</span><span class="s">(</span> <span class="i">$val</span> == <span class="n">0</span> <span class="s">)</span><span class="s">{</span>

It does this by normalizing the contents. PPI currently supports two 
levels of normalization although in my testing I have not been able to
get different output from the different levels (or layers as the documentation
calls them).
<p />
Be forewarned though, this is definitely bleeding code with mismatches between
documentation and implementation as well as unlocalized use of <tt>$_</tt>. I
also wonder about the design decision for the unimplemented <tt>compare</tt> of
a target filename to mean the filename contains a store of what to compare and
not the simple DWIMy: file itself is the target for comparison.
<p />
P.S. If you know of a better/more comparable diff output let me know&ndash;jpierce@cpan&ndash;I
could have sworn there was a means for diff -r to give similar +/- output but
I might be thinking of my own dirdiff.
